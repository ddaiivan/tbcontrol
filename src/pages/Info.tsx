                  Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. 
                  TB primarily affects the lungs (known as pulmonary TB), but it can also affect other organs such as lymph nodes, 
                  bones, kidneys, and the brain (known as extrapulmonary TB).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  TB spreads through the air when infected individuals with active TB cough, sneeze, speak, or spit. They unknowingly 
                  release TB bacteria into the air, which can then be inhaled by others nearby.

    question: "Can TB be cured?",
    answer: "Yes, TB can be cured with proper treatment. TB treatment typically involves a combination of several antibiotics that must be taken regularly for 6-9 months, depending on the patient's condition. It is very important to complete the entire treatment regimen even if symptoms disappear to prevent recurrence and avoid developing drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).",
  },
  {
    question: "How can TB transmission be prevented?",
    answer: "TB prevention includes: 1) Good home ventilation, 2) Proper cough and sneeze etiquette, 3) Avoiding crowded places with poor air circulation if you're at high risk, 4) BCG vaccination for infants, 5) Prompt treatment if diagnosed with TB to stop transmission, 6) Ensuring TB patients use masks, especially during the early phase of treatment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the BCG vaccine prevent TB?",
    answer: "The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin) vaccine is given to infants to provide protection against serious forms of TB such as TB meningitis and miliary TB that commonly affect children. However, the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in preventing pulmonary TB in adults varies. Nevertheless, BCG vaccination remains an important strategy in TB control programs, especially in countries with high TB burden like Indonesia.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does TB only affect the lungs?",
    answer: "No. Although TB most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB), TB bacteria can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. TB that affects organs other than the lungs is called extrapulmonary TB. Extrapulmonary TB can affect the lymph nodes, bones and joints, central nervous system (TB meningitis), genitourinary system, skin, and other organs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is TB diagnosed?",
    answer: "TB diagnosis involves several methods, including: 1) Examination of clinical symptoms, 2) Sputum tests to detect TB bacteria, 3) Chest X-rays, 4) Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux), 5) Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) blood tests, 6) In more complex cases, tissue biopsy or molecular tests such as GeneXpert MTB/RIF may be needed. Diagnosis can only be made by trained healthcare professionals.",
